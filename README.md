# TwitterBot-like-rt

I made a bot using tweepy and Twitter Developer. There are many tutorials on Youtube to learn how to use it.

tweepy.OAuthHandler ('','') has two parameters, also auth.set_access_token.

'search': you can search for hashtags, words or people.
'nrTeewts': this is the number of tweets your bot will like or retweet. Be careful with Twitter's policy.

This bot automattically gives a like.

Also, you can change 'tweet.favorite()' for 'tweet.retweet()' for a RT.
